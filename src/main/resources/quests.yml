# Daily Quests Configuration
# =============================================================================
# Quests are assigned daily to players based on their active jobs.
# Difficulty and rewards scale dynamically with job level and prestige.
#
# Quest amounts and rewards are BASE values — they scale up automatically:
#   Scaled Amount  = base * (1 + level * level-scaling-factor) * (1 + prestige * prestige-scaling-factor)
#   Scaled Reward  = base * (1 + level * level-scaling-factor * 1.5) * (1 + prestige * prestige-scaling-factor * 1.5)
# =============================================================================

settings:
  # Enable or disable the daily quest system
  enabled: true

  quests-per-day: 3

  # Time of day quests reset (server timezone, 24h format)
  reset-time: "00:00"

  # How much each job level increases difficulty/rewards (0.02 = +2% per level)
  level-scaling-factor: 0.02

  # How much each prestige increases difficulty/rewards (0.15 = +15% per prestige)
  prestige-scaling-factor: 0.15
